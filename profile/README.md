Why the separate organization?

Well, like Corrado, I have sleep apnea. I've had it for a while. I tried and failed to acclimate with therapy many times.

Until this time. I surrendered to the fact I needed CPAP and reframed treatment in my head.

My CPAP is named  `Uncle Jun`, and this is all the shit I've been able to build now that I'm actually rested.

Hope some of it is useful!
